    Creates a connection pool with the supplied parameters and returns it.

    The dsn parameter (data source name) can be a string in the format
    user/password@connect_string or can simply be the connect string (in
    which case the user and password need to be specified separately). See the
    documentation on connection strings for more information.

    The pool_class parameter is expected to be ConnectionPool or a subclass of
    ConnectionPool.

    The params parameter is expected to be of type PoolParams and contains
    parameters that are used to create the pool. See the documentation on
    PoolParams for more information. If this parameter is not specified, the
    additional keyword parameters will be used to create an instance of
    PoolParams. If both the params parameter and additional keyword parameters
    are specified an exception is raised. Note that if a dsn is also supplied,
    the params will be modified to contain the connection parameters found
    within the dsn.
